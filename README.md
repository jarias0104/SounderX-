# SounderX-
Develop a music playing app showing modern features


# How to work on the project

Based on the design we will work on windows forms and functionalities and also back end to put music, users and any other data in a 
database

1. Create a branch from main to work on your part

For example: If I will work on the playlist windows i create a branch from main and work with those files
then after being sure those files can be merged to main and wont have conflicts we can pull a merge request

2. Create a issue for your work and assign it

For example if I have a branch for playlist windows I go to issues and create a issue then assign myself to it
so that the other knows what Im working in and what im not working in
